## Welcome to Sophia Strano's Page

My name is Sophia Strano, but since you're here you can call me Sophie. I'm a current Junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science as well as a bachelors in Bioinformatics and Computional Biology. 

This is my page dedicated to cataloging some of my favorite projects and experiences, and other occasional updates in my life. Tanti auguri!

### About Me
I do spend most of my time focused on my studies at WPI, but I manage to squeeze in some fun free time for my hobbies (like my site ;) )
```markdown
**Residential Advising** I began work as an RA on WPI campus at the beginning of my sophomore year, right in the middle of the pandemic. Despite the inherent challenges that come with that, I've been really thankful for my position as I'm constantly given the opportunity to organize events for my community and stay involved and in touch with other students (and fuel my love for jackbox games).
**Technichords Acapella**
**Musical Theatre Experience**
**Hiking and Outdoor Exploration**
**Original Music**
**Painting and Other Artwork**

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
