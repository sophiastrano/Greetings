## Welcome to Sophia Strano's Page

My name is Sophia Strano, but since you're here you can call me Sophie. I'm a recent graduate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, obtaining my bachelor's in Computer Science as well as a bachelors in Bioinformatics and Computional Biology this past may. 

This is my page dedicated to cataloging some of my favorite projects and experiences from my undergrad experience, and other occasional updates on hobby projects.

### About Me
I now work full time at Brendan BioScience post-grad, but I manage to squeeze in some fun free time for my hobbies (like my site ;) )
```markdown
**Residential Advising** I began work as an RA on WPI campus at the beginning of my sophomore year, right in the middle of the pandemic. Despite the inherent challenges that come with that, I've been really thankful for the experience gained while I held the position, I really enjoyed being given the opportunity to organize events for my community and stay involved and in touch with other students (and fuel my love for jackbox games).
**Technichords Acapella**
**Musical Theatre Experience**
**Hiking and Outdoor Exploration**
**Original Music**
